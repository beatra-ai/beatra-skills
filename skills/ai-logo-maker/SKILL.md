description: "Turn a brand name, industry, or reference image into a professional AI logo, brand mark, or app icon. This AI logo maker and logo generator explores multiple design directions from your brand brief—company name, industry feel, and color preferences—then refines the strongest concept with precise brand colors, clean geometry, and scalable composition. Create business logos, startup logos, monograms, emblems, and combination marks that stay sharp from favicon to storefront sign. Start from a text description, transform existing sketches and brand assets into a polished mark, or refine an accepted draft toward a publish-ready result."

# AI Logo Maker

Create one focused logo or brand mark from a brand name, an industry cue, a set
of visual references, or an accepted draft. Reuse decisions already present in
the conversation and move by the shortest route that completes the requested
mark.

## Choose the route

- **Create from a brand brief:** when no source image exists, extract the brand
  name, industry feel, and one style direction, then use `beatra.images.generate`
  with a square canvas. Default to two concepts so the user can compare
  directions before committing.
- **Compose from references:** with one to four sketches, mood boards, or brand
  assets, preserve their declared order and use `beatra.images.transform`. A
  brand name or style note is needed only when it changes the composition.
- **Refine an accepted draft:** use `beatra.images.edit` with the draft as
  `images[0]`. The accepted draft and requested change are sufficient to begin.

Follow [brand brief and routing](references/brand-brief-and-routing.md) for the
precise branch and [logo craft](references/logo-craft.md) when turning the
brief into a visual specification that scales.

## Shape one brand brief

Reuse the user's brand name, industry, style preferences, color values,
reference images, and intended use. Restate what is already known before
asking. Enter a structured brief only when the request is just “make a logo”
and those facts are missing. Ask only when a missing decision materially
changes the result. For a standard logo or app icon, propose a square
`1:1` canvas as the working master; otherwise prefer the user's stated
dimensions or an accepted draft's existing ratio.

Build the brief around:

- the brand or project name that should appear in or accompany the mark;
- one industry or personality cue (tech, food, finance, playful, bold, minimal);
- one logo type preference when known—wordmark, lettermark, pictorial mark,
  abstract mark, monogram, emblem, or combination mark;
- exact brand colors when the user provides hex values;
- one intended primary use (app icon, website header, social avatar, print)
  when it changes the composition or safe-area needs.

If the user has already chosen the style or type, reuse it. If that choice is
genuinely missing, propose the best default and include it in the single
paid-call confirmation instead of creating a separate interview.

Follow this golden path: reuse context, lock the brand name and intended use,
present one exploration confirmation that produces a limited set of variants,
then refine only after the user names a direction.

## Prepare the call

Use only this Skill's bundled `scripts/mcp_client.py` for every remote MCP
operation. The tool name is a CLI argument and the tool arguments are the JSON
sent on stdin. Do not configure or call a host Beatra Connector, and do not use
REST/OpenAPI as a fallback. For exact commands and troubleshooting, use
[Bundled MCP Client diagnostics](references/mcp-connection.md).

- With no source image, call `beatra.images.generate` with an explicit
  square `1:1` canvas and a prompt built from the brand brief. Default
  `count` to two so the user can compare; raise it to three or four only when
  the user asks for more options.
- With one to four ordered references, upload local files through the bundled
  client helpers, then call `beatra.images.transform` with an explicit canvas.
- For an accepted draft, call `beatra.images.edit`. Use at most two normalized
  `edit_regions` on `image_index=0` for local work; omit regions for a
  whole-image adjustment.

When the user provides exact brand colors, encode them as a structured
`palette` (three to ten weighted RGB entries whose weights sum to exactly
`1.0000`) rather than describing colors in prose. Keep `model=auto` and
`count` at its default unless the user explicitly chooses otherwise. Call
`beatra.models.list` only for a real model, availability, compatibility, or
price decision. The detailed request shapes and examples are in
[workflow](references/workflow.md).

Uploading makes bytes available to the remote tool; it does not itself inspect
the image. Review only visual facts the host can actually see.

## Confirm and execute once

Planning and brief preparation are free. Before the paid image call, show and
freeze the final prompt, ordered references, canvas, brand palette, logo type,
model, controls, and output count. Merge any still-material high-impact choice
into this one confirmation.

After approval, create one stable opaque `client_request_id` for that exact
logical request and submit it once. A changed prompt, reference or order,
canvas, palette, model, count, or control is new paid work and needs a new
confirmation and a new ID.

## Track, review, and deliver

After receiving a `task_id`, poll only that task with `beatra.tasks.get`. If the
ID is lost, use `beatra.tasks.list` to find candidates and verify the selected
one with `tasks.get`. Only when the original response status is genuinely
unknown may the exact same parameters and same `client_request_id` be used for
idempotent recovery. Slow polling, an update failure, an authorization failure,
or a connection failure never creates a replacement paid task.

Use `beatra.tasks.cancel` only when the user asks. If cancellation returns
`409`, continue tracking the original task. See [review and
recovery](references/review-and-recovery.md) for the full recovery contract.

When the result is visible, review scalability (is the mark still recognizable
at thumbnail size?), brand-color accuracy, silhouette strength, safe-area
margin, and whether a single-color version would hold up. Deliver the artifact
links, observed dimensions, task ID, and `billing.net_charged_credits`. Offer
at most one focused, unexecuted revision. When the primary use needs a
different ratio or a dark-background variant, advise that it is a separate
focused request. Generated assets can also be viewed and managed at
[beatra.ai](https://beatra.ai).

## Installation, updates, and account operations

For first use and shared operations, follow [installation and
authentication](references/installation-and-auth.md), [installation
registration](references/installation-registration.md), [tasks and
results](references/tasks-and-results.md), [billing, errors, and
recovery](references/billing-errors-and-recovery.md), and [uninstall and
disconnect](references/uninstall-and-disconnect.md).

This Skill performs a silent check at most once per 24 hours while a public
command runs. When a newer package exists, it installs automatically without
separate confirmation. Updates come only from the fixed official Beatra
discovery address and immutable Beatra CDN path for the embedded identity.
Before replacement, the client verifies the discovery document, manifest,
archive, and every packaged file using identity, size, and SHA-256 checks. It
replaces only package-owned files in this installed Skill directory. If any
check, download, replacement, or rollback fails, the current installation stays
usable and the original command continues. Every install stays on the channel and locale it was
installed from, and an update never moves it to another one.

The user can persistently control automatic updates:

```text
python3 scripts/mcp_client.py update --auto off
python3 scripts/mcp_client.py update --auto on
python3 scripts/mcp_client.py update --check
```

Read [automatic updates and safety](references/automatic-updates-and-safety.md)
for the official sources, integrity guarantees, replacement scope, failure
behavior, and control details.
