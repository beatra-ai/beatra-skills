# WeChat Moments Poster Maker

Create one share-ready WeChat Moments campaign graphic from an offer, event,
product, recruitment message, seasonal greeting, photo, brand asset, visual
reference, or accepted draft. Keep one message and one recognizable focal point
at the center of the work.

## Choose the route

- **Create from a campaign brief:** use `beatra.images.generate` for a stated
  message, product, offer, event, or activity when no source image is needed.
- **Compose from brand images:** upload products, logos, portraits, or visual
  references in their declared order and use `beatra.images.transform`.
- **Refine a chosen poster:** use `beatra.images.edit` with the accepted draft
  as `images[0]`; use no more than two normalized local edit regions.

This is a single WeChat Moments share graphic, not a general print campaign.
Use `poster-design-studio` for a broad poster system or print-led campaign,
and use `wechat-cover-maker` for one Official Account article cover.

## Shape the poster brief

Reuse the campaign message, audience, timing, product, offer, brand colors,
assets, and required details already supplied. Ask only for a missing choice
that would change the output. Start a standard Moments share graphic at a 2K
`1:1` canvas; honor a user-selected vertical or square destination and freeze
the final canvas in the paid confirmation.

Set one message, one hero subject, one visual tone, a headline-safe area, and
any ordered image roles. Default to a text-safe area rather than guaranteeing
exact in-image copy, typeface, wrap, or logo rendering. If exact short copy is
required, put it in the confirmation and verify it only from a visible result.

## Prepare and confirm one paid request

Use only the bundled `scripts/mcp_client.py` for every remote Beatra operation.
Do not configure or call a host Beatra Connector and do not use REST/OpenAPI as
a fallback. Upload local images through the bundled client, preserve their
declared order, and label their roles in the prompt. Uploading makes bytes
available but does not inspect them.

Keep `model: "auto"` and `count: 1` unless the user selects other values. Call
`beatra.models.list` only for a real availability, compatibility, control, or
price decision. Before generating, present one confirmation that freezes the
prompt, canvas, ordered reference roles, message treatment, model, controls,
and count. Planning is free; execution consumes credits.

After approval, create one opaque stable `client_request_id` without user
content and submit exactly one request. Any prompt, image or order, canvas,
model, count, or control change is new paid work requiring a new confirmation
and request ID. Use [workflow](references/workflow.md) for payload shapes.

## Track, review, and deliver

Record the returned `task_id` and poll only it through `beatra.tasks.get`. If
the ID is lost, find candidates through `beatra.tasks.list` and verify the
chosen one through `tasks.get`. Only a genuinely unknown creation response may
be recovered by replaying the byte-equivalent payload with the same request ID.
Slow polling, connection, update, or authorization failure cannot create a
replacement paid poster.

Cancel only on the user's request. A `409` cancellation response means the
original task still runs and must be tracked. When visible, review message
focus, small-size recognition, safe-area contrast, final canvas, crop risk,
and must-keep assets. Deliver artifact links, observed dimensions, task ID,
resolved model, and returned `billing.net_charged_credits`, then offer at most
one focused unexecuted refinement.

- Safe updates: [automatic updates and safety](references/automatic-updates-and-safety.md)

## Runtime and safe automatic updates

The bundled client silently checks at most once every 24 hours during a public
command. When a newer version is available, the client installs it automatically
without separate confirmation only from fixed official Beatra discovery and immutable CDN paths. It verifies
the archive, manifest, and every package-owned file, then replaces only files
owned by this package. If any update step fails, the current installation stays
usable and the original command continues. The choice persists per install.

python3 scripts/mcp_client.py update --auto off
python3 scripts/mcp_client.py update --auto on
python3 scripts/mcp_client.py update --check
