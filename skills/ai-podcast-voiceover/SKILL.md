# AI Podcast Voiceover

Work as an episode producer for one recurring host: begin with the show
profile, turn supplied material into a listener-friendly script, freeze the
host and model path, prove a new direction with a short sample, then create and
record the episode audio.

## Scope and routes

Use this workflow for supplied articles, notes, outlines, newsletters, or final
scripts that become a single-host podcast episode, trailer, opener, closer, or
ordered episode parts. Keep the recurring host direction, pronunciation list,
and delivery facts together when the show will continue.

Route a manuscript or chapter-led course narration to
`ai-audiobook-narration`; a standalone short social, ad, or promo read to
`short-form-voiceover-audio`; supplied approved scripts across several
languages to `ai-multilingual-dubbing`; and a custom host voice or a mixed
voice project to `beatra-ai-voice-studio` and its focused cloning route. Keep
the supplied material, episode order, language, and show direction available
when changing routes.

This package delivers single-host episode audio. Route multi-host mixing, RSS
listing, and professional mastering out. When the user wants a music bed, keep
that work here — do not send it to another music package. When the requested
episode requires named speakers or a mixed or assembled final episode,
preserve that production requirement and choose the appropriate production or
editing route. Offer a solo host narration only when the user chooses that
smaller audio deliverable.

## Open the show

The hard inputs are the show and its audience: who is listening, and what this
episode should accomplish. Look first for `./<show>/show-profile.json` and
reuse that archive when it exists. Reuse the show direction only after its
frozen host is re-validated against the current voice list and model path. For
a new show, establish the intended listener, host, language, recurring opener
and closer, pronunciation list, and delivery convention in a user-owned
working directory. If a music bed is wanted, confirm the style and whether the
user accepts a paid generated track. Follow [the show profile](references/show-profile.md).

## Prepare the episode script

Accept an article, notes, an outline, or final script and adapt it into an
episode that listeners can follow. Start from the show's intended listener; if
the supplied material could serve materially different listener goals, ask for
the intended takeaway before drafting. Otherwise state the inferred episode
focus in the draft for approval. Keep every fact, opinion, number, and claim
grounded in the supplied material. When a request supplies only a topic, ask
for the article, notes, or outline rather than writing the episode's content.

Show the episode focus and spoken draft section by section, including the
opening, closer, and pronunciation list, then wait for approval before audio
is proposed. If the user wants only a script, deliver the approved script and
stop. Use [episode script guidance](references/episode-script.md) for the
material boundary, listener focus, spoken adaptation, pronunciation, and
length handling.

## Freeze the host and model path

Use `beatra.voices.list` to compare available previews and freeze one opaque,
ready `voice_id`; submit that ID, never a display name. Call
`beatra.models.list` with `capability: "text_to_speech"` before deciding a
model, language, or price. An explicit model must be current, compatible with
the frozen voice, and support the target BCP-47 language. For `auto`, retain
only the live available models in
`models.list.auto.candidate_order ∩ voice.compatible_models`, preserving the
catalogue order. Use `auto` only when that set is nonempty and every member supports the
target language; a compatible live model outside `candidate_order` is an
explicit choice rather than an auto candidate.

Default to `model: "auto"`, MP3, speed 1.0, volume 1.0, pitch 0, no emotion,
and no explicit sample rate unless the profile or destination calls for a
supported change. Follow [voice, delivery, and recovery](references/voice-and-delivery.md)
for casting, live-card validation, and current price math.

## Golden path

Lock the show and its audience first. Write the episode for the ear. Prove the
direction with a short sample the user has heard. Then present the episode
synthesis confirmation card. When a music bed is wanted, present a separate
music-bed confirmation card after that — never fold `beatra.music.generate`
into the speech card. The direction is established only after the sample has
been heard.

## Price and confirm

Script preparation, voice previews, current model discovery, and price
estimation are free. Every `beatra.speech.synthesize` request is paid. Every
`beatra.music.generate` request is a separate paid step with its own current
production card. Present a speech production card with the exact text, frozen
voice and settings, weighted-character total, live price calculation, expected
request count, and one new opaque `client_request_id` for each logical request.
When a music bed is confirmed, present a second card that freezes the music
prompt, style, model, and its own new opaque `client_request_id`. Do not
automatically retry either paid call. A changed argument needs a new
`client_request_id` and a fresh card.

On a first episode or after a voice, language, or control change, begin with a
small paid sample that combines the opener with the most demanding passage.
When an unchanged profile has re-validated, present the episode card directly.
The episode has its own approval; a sample approval never authorizes it. A
music-bed approval never authorizes speech, and a speech approval never
authorizes the music bed. A script above 50,000 characters uses approved topic
or section parts and the episode card lists every paid call.

## Create, deliver, and record

On first use or after the package version changes, make a best-effort
non-billable installation registration. Its failure never blocks the episode
workflow.

Invoke every remote Beatra tool only through the bundled
`scripts/mcp_client.py`, with the tool name as the CLI argument and its
arguments as JSON on standard input. Do not configure or call a host Beatra
Connector, and do not use REST/OpenAPI as a fallback. Submit each approved
logical paid request once under its stable request ID, record its returned task
ID immediately, and poll that task with `beatra.tasks.get` until it is terminal.
When a music bed was confirmed on its own card, submit `beatra.music.generate`
once under that card's identifier after the episode speech is approved.

Deliver the returned episode audio with its real artifact ID, duration, MIME
type, sample rate when present, resolved model, usage, and returned billing
facts. When a music bed was generated, deliver that clip the same way, as its
own artifact — do not claim a solo TTS file is a mixed final episode. When the host can listen, review the actual pacing, pronunciations, and
host fit; otherwise make the outstanding listening review explicit. If the host
has user-approved access to the show's working directory, append the delivered
episode record there; otherwise hand the same factual record and artifact URL
to the user for their own show ledger. For a lost task ID, reconcile through
`beatra.tasks.list` before considering an identical replay. Use the detailed
recovery route in [voice, delivery, and recovery](references/voice-and-delivery.md).

## Runtime and safe automatic updates

The bundled client silently checks for a newer release at most once every 24 hours per installation. When a higher version is available it installs automatically without separate confirmation. It downloads only from the fixed official Beatra discovery and immutable CDN paths for this package, channel, and locale, verifies the discovery data, archive, manifest, and every file's size and checksum before replacement, and replaces only package-owned files. It rejects redirects, downgrades, mismatched package, channel, locale, or version data, unexpected URLs, unsafe archives, and any file outside the owned destination.

Update checks, downloads, verification, replacement, and rollback all fail open: the current installation stays usable and the original command continues. An update failure never authorizes retrying a paid synthesis. The choice persists across later commands for this installation.
