# Video Generation Studio

Turn an idea or supplied media into one directed short clip. Start with the user's outcome, shape one readable shot, choose the matching video operation, and review the real delivery before proposing another paid stage.

## Scope and adjacent routes

Use this Skill for text-to-video, an exact opening image, exact first and last frames, loose multimodal references, edits to existing footage, and footage added immediately before or after one source clip. It is a broad video workspace for short ads, product stories, social clips, b-roll, transitions, reveals, and cinematic concepts.

Captions, narration production, speech synthesis, and timeline assembly are separate jobs. A multi-shot request can be planned and delivered as separate clips, but this workflow does not claim to join them into one timeline. Use a focused talking-avatar or image-to-motion workflow when that narrower result is the whole request; remain here when the user needs broader route selection or several distinct shot types.

Prefer media the user already supplied. When there is no usable still, deliver one keyframe with `beatra.images.generate` as its own paid stage before any video call. Do not silently replace a usable source. A delivered keyframe does not authorize `beatra.videos.generate`, `beatra.videos.animate`, `beatra.videos.interpolate`, `beatra.videos.generate_from_references`, `beatra.videos.edit`, or `beatra.videos.extend`.

## Inputs and defaults

The minimum hard input is one of:

- a written description of the shot;
- one accessible image that must be the opening frame;
- two accessible images that must be the first and last frames;
- accessible image, video, or audio references within the selected live card's count and duration limits, with clear order and purpose; or
- one accessible source video plus a precise edit instruction or an extension direction.

Ask only for information that changes the route or result. Reuse known destination, duration, ratio, resolution, subject, action, camera, pacing, audio intent, visual references, and must-keeps. When these are unspecified, default to one short clip, one readable action, one primary camera move, `model: "auto"`, the shortest integer duration the selected live card admits, and the lowest admitted resolution unless the user named a higher tier (Pro / 2K / 1080p). Do not omit duration on `model: "auto"`, and do not hard-code 8, 10, or 15 when the card allows a shorter integer. Omit aspect ratio for source-led routes unless the user explicitly approves a canvas change.

For a local image, audio file, or video that the host Agent can access, inspect it first and use the bundled upload helper:

```text
python3 scripts/mcp_client.py upload ./approved-input.mp4 --mime-type video/mp4
```

Upload is transport, not media review. Keep the returned artifact reference and never pass a local path to a remote tool.

## Choose one video route

Select exactly one video operation for each logical paid stage:

1. No usable still or other required visual source: one `beatra.images.generate` keyframe first with `text_to_image` model facts and its own card; after that delivery, usually `beatra.videos.animate` with `image_to_video` model facts. `beatra.videos.generate` with `text_to_video` model facts remains available only after that keyframe and a video admission card.
2. One image is the strict opening frame: `beatra.videos.animate` with `image_to_video` model facts.
3. Two images are strict first and last frames: `beatra.videos.interpolate` with `frames_to_video` model facts.
4. Ordered image, video, or audio media guides a new clip without fixing boundary frames: `beatra.videos.generate_from_references` with `reference_to_video` model facts.
5. Existing footage must change: `beatra.videos.edit` with `video_edit` model facts.
6. Footage must be added immediately before or after exactly one source clip: `beatra.videos.extend` with `video_extend` model facts. Its required integer `duration` is the final returned-video duration, must exceed the trusted source duration, and is not the number of seconds to add.

Do not exchange these routes casually. Editing changes existing content, extension continues one clip, references guide a new clip, animation preserves one image as the opening frame, and interpolation uses two boundary frames. `beatra.videos.extend` neither joins clips nor assembles a timeline.

## Golden path

1. Inspect every accessible source. Record each media role plus its actual MIME type, byte size, dimensions and aspect ratio for images, duration for audio and video, and any other fact required by the live card. State the destination, one visible event, pacing, camera, audio intent, and must-keeps. If the host cannot inspect a property or the media itself, say so instead of inventing it.
2. Choose one of the six video routes after any required keyframe. Read [Intent and routing](references/intent-and-routing.md) for ambiguous sources or multi-shot work, and [Shot design](references/shot-design.md) to turn the goal into a concise direction. When there is no usable still, the first paid stage is one keyframe; read [Image-assisted video](references/image-assisted-video.md).
3. Call `beatra.models.list` for that stage's exact capability before relying on model availability, accepted input combinations, media limits, controls, durations, ratios, resolutions, or price. Keep `model: "auto"` unless the user chose a concrete eligible model. An explicitly named model is evaluated as requested and is never silently replaced. Write the shortest admitted integer duration and the lowest admitted resolution unless the user named a higher tier.
4. Admit the complete payload against one current eligible model card. Compare actual media kind, MIME type, byte size, dimensions, aspect ratio, duration, reference counts and combinations, and supported controls as applicable. For editing and extension, include the trusted source-video duration. If a required fact is unavailable or no live card accepts the planned payload, stop before the paid call and request the smallest compatible source or plan change.
5. When there is no usable still, show the keyframe's own card — route `text_to_image`, tool `beatra.images.generate`, direction, canvas if set, output count, and provisional live estimate — then submit that image stage once and deliver the still. Use `beatra.images.transform` only for one to four ordered references that should form a new shot frame, or `beatra.images.edit` when `images[0]` is the base and a bounded part should change. Inspect the delivered still before constructing dependent video work. This image card does not authorize any video call.
6. Show a video admission card before any `client_request_id` or `beatra.videos.generate`, `beatra.videos.animate`, `beatra.videos.interpolate`, `beatra.videos.generate_from_references`, `beatra.videos.edit`, or `beatra.videos.extend` call: route and MCP tool name, live-card duration, resolution, and aspect, provisional live estimate, the fact that the 600-credit signup gift usually cannot start this video, the exact URL `https://console.beatra.ai/topup`, and starter ¥29 / 11,000 credits. Do not recommend ¥198. Numeric estimates come only from current model cards; the terminal task's `billing.net_charged_credits` is final. Planning, comparison, or “make the clip” is not approval. Do not create `client_request_id` or submit until the user confirms they have topped up or already have enough credits for this estimate.
7. Freeze the exact payload with one opaque stable `client_request_id`. Invoke only the bundled client: put the MCP tool name after `call` and its JSON arguments on standard input. For example:

   ```text
   printf '%s' '{"prompt":"A close product reveal with one slow push-in and a stable background.","model":"auto","client_request_id":"opaque-video-id"}' | python3 scripts/mcp_client.py call beatra.videos.generate
   ```

   Do not configure, call, or depend on a host Beatra Connector. Do not use REST/OpenAPI as a fallback. Submit the frozen request exactly once.
8. Record the returned task ID immediately and poll that same task with `beatra.tasks.get` until terminal. Queued and running are progress, not failure. Do not resubmit because a task is slow.
9. Deliver every returned video or image artifact or link. Report only actual terminal status, resolved model, dimensions, duration, usage, and `billing.net_charged_credits`. Review what is accessible for the requested action, subject stability, camera, continuity, audio, must-keeps, and destination fit. State what the host Agent could and could not inspect.
10. Recommend the smallest useful next step: accept the clip, make one focused edit, extend it, or create a new render. Never imply that an unreviewed clip is a finished campaign asset.

## Multi-shot work and paid confirmation

For a multi-shot request, plan each shot as a separate delivered clip. Freeze the shot list, route and exact payload for each stage, dependencies, required or optional still stages, total paid-call count, and provisional estimate before execution. A text-led shot with no usable still still needs its keyframe card first. One explicit confirmation of the plan does not authorize any video stage; each video generate, animate, interpolate, reference, edit, or extend call still needs its own admission card and top-up or balance confirmation. Every paid request still has its own stable ID and is submitted once.

Run dependent stages in order. Review an image before its video and review a clip or returned last frame before relying on it downstream. If a delivery materially changes the next approved shot, pause and re-plan that next stage rather than silently using stale assumptions. Deliver separate clips and explain that timeline assembly remains outside this workflow.

## Changes, recovery, and cancellation

A changed tool, model, source, source order, prompt or instruction, direction, duration, aspect ratio, resolution, or optional control is new logical paid work. Assign a new ID, show a new admission card for a video stage, and obtain fresh top-up or balance confirmation unless it was already included in a frozen admitted sequence. Never reuse an ID for changed arguments. On `insufficient_balance`, relay the returned public message, keep the URL `https://console.beatra.ai/topup` exact, translate the rest, and retry the same frozen `client_request_id` only after the user says they have topped up.

If a create response is lost, retry only the identical frozen payload with its same request ID. If the task ID is lost, call `beatra.tasks.list` for the relevant capability, inspect plausible candidates with `beatra.tasks.get`, and match them to the private request ledger before considering an identical retry. Recover the original request before planning a replacement; never duplicate a paid submission or guess its artifact, charge, refund, or state.

Call `beatra.tasks.cancel` only when the user asks to cancel. Call it once and confirm the resulting terminal state with `beatra.tasks.get`. A 409 does not confirm cancellation, so continue polling the same task rather than creating replacement work.

## Runtime and safe automatic updates

Use or invoke the bundled `scripts/mcp_client.py` for every Beatra operation. Before ordinary commands it silently checks for a newer release at most once every 24 hours per installation. Silent checks are enabled by default, and a newer release installs without separate confirmation.

The updater accepts only the fixed official discovery address and immutable Beatra CDN path embedded for this package, channel, and locale. It verifies the discovery data, archive, manifest, and every file's size and checksum before replacement. It replaces only package-owned files and rejects redirects, downgrades, wrong package/channel/locale/version data, unexpected URLs, unsafe archives, and files outside the owned destination.

Update checks, downloads, verification, replacement, rollback, and recovery fail open: the current installation remains usable and the user's original command continues. An update failure never authorizes retrying a paid generation. The automatic-update choice persists across later commands for this installation:

```text
python3 scripts/mcp_client.py update --auto off
python3 scripts/mcp_client.py update --auto on
python3 scripts/mcp_client.py update --check
```

`--auto off` disables silent checks, `--auto on` restores them, and `--check` reports the official available version without replacing files.
